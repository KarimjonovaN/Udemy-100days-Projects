## Day 48 Projects

Selenium automation mini-projects:

- Python.org Events Scraper: collects upcoming event dates and titles from `python.org`.
- Web Form Autocomplete: fills and submits a demo sign-up form.
- Cookie Clicker Bot: plays Cookie Clicker and auto-buys upgrades.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Google Chrome installed
- Selenium for Python: `pip install selenium`

Note: Modern Selenium auto-manages ChromeDriver, but if needed, ensure your ChromeDriver matches your Chrome version.

---

## How to Run

- Optional: create and activate a virtual environment
- Install dependencies: `pip install selenium`
- Run an individual script from this folder, for example:
  - `python main.py`  (Python.org events)
  - `python interaction.py`  (Form automation)
  - `python cookies.py`  (Cookie Clicker bot)

Some scripts keep Chrome open using the "detach" option; close the browser to end sessions.
