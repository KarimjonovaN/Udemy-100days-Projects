# Udemy 100 Days of Python – Projects

This repository contains my implementations for the Udemy "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course. Each `day_X_projects` folder includes one or more focused exercises or mini-projects for that day. Where relevant, each folder contains its own `README.md` with features, how to run instructions, and screenshots.

---

## How to Run Any Project

- Optional: create and activate a virtual environment
- Install any dependencies noted in the folder's README or code comments
- Run the main Python file in that folder, for example: `python main.py`
