## Day 54 Projects

Topics covered: higher-order functions and Python decorators. Includes:

- Simple decorator that delays function execution and demonstrates pre/post behavior.
- Examples using `@decorator` syntax and manual decoration.

---

## Files

- `app.py`: contains decorator examples and small Selenium practice snippets (commented sections from earlier days).

---

## How to Run

- Optional: create and activate a virtual environment
- Run: `python app.py`

Note: If you uncomment any Selenium snippets, install Selenium with `pip install selenium` and have Chrome available.
